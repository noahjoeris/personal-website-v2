Bitcoin isn’t just another form of money—it’s the first time humanity has real financial freedom.

### **1. Teleporting Value**

Bitcoin is the only system that lets you send value over a communication channel without a trusted third party. Gold can’t do this. Banks can’t do this. Only Bitcoin can.

### **2. Set-in-Stone Monetary Policy**

Bitcoin’s supply is fixed and transparent. And it will stay that way, forever. Digital scarcity makes it very predictable, unlike fiat currencies that are inflated at will.

### **3. The Evil of Inflation**

Money printing robs non-asset holders. To preserve purchasing power, people are forced into gambling on stocks that barely keep up. During Covid, 10x more money was printed than in the 2008 financial crisis—and the numbers keep climbing. We live in a debt-driven economy where only those with access to cheap credit win (aka the rich).

### **4. Money Detached from Governments**

Power corrupts. Ultimate power corrupts absolutely. Money in the hands of governments and central banks is ultimate power which leads to abuse. In every crisis, they expand their control. If you give governments more power during crisis they will surely create one. Money should be fully detached from governments.

### **5. First True Non-Custodial Asset**

For the first time in history, you can hold an asset without counterparty risk. Gold always needs a custodian, bound to a single jurisdiction. Bitcoin changes this with multisigs, allowing custody across multiple jurisdictions. No other asset can match that.

### **Conclusion**

Bitcoin is more than money—it’s a revolution in trust, freedom, and fairness. For the first time, value is independent from governments, banks, and borders. It’s scarce, unstoppable, and belongs only to those who hold it.

That’s why Bitcoin isn’t just the best money. It’s the only money that truly serves humanity.
