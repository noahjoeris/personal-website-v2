Here are some ideas and insights I was thinking about in 2024. Maybe it inspires :)

- A strict diet, quitting sugar, getting in shape, and doing cold exposure is still underrated in solving 80% of human problems.
- You are going to outperform 90% of people just with consistency. Just by showing up. Only the last 10% is about intensity.
- You can believe not being worthy of a thing but still attain it. Having no self belief but show up anyway. Question the process and your talent. Feeling like not working hard enough and never giving yourself a break. Self belief is overrated, generate evidence.
- Be less serious, more playful, and absurd - while still nailing your goals. You are going to die in a not so distant future so you better enjoy it fully. How can you make what you're doing 10x more fun? What would make this awesome?
- How can you say you're bad at something if you haven't put in the volume? Do it 1000 times before complaining that it's hard.
- Being pulled by values instead of pushed by artificial goals is magical. To only focus on what's inside our control and relying on good systems. Combined with the mindset of accepting to see no reward for the effort in the next decade while never giving up.
- You are very dangerous if you get to a point where you don't even think about how you feel. Just do the thing. There's no correlation between how you feel and your performance in the gym.
- Life is full of opportunities, you are just too distracted to see them. If you're lost the answer is education, if you're educated the answer is execution, if you're executing the answer is consistency.
- Striving for true mental peace instead of fleeting pleasures is way more rewarding. For me it's about developing a virtuous character. Of the 150+ books Iâ€™ve read, none have been more transformative than the hard philosophy ones. If you want to be happy study happiness.
