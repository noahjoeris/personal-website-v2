  summary:
    "Hello, I'm Noah, a software magician at Velocity Labs, specializing in React and Rust. \
  I'm responsible for building amazing apps and tools that boost the adoption of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n\
  I graduated from the Polkadot Blockchain Academy 2024 in Hong Kong, where I formed valuable connections \
  in the web3 industry. Previously, I worked at Airbus Defence and Space for almost 5 years, contributing to \
  various departments, including cyber security, cloud, and blockchain projects. I engineered numerous software \
  applications there and developed extensively in React.\n\n\
  I hold a Bachelor in Computer Science and Cyber Security from Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences.\n\n\
  Besides, I really enjoy calisthenics, cold plunges, biohacking, reading, and occasionally gaming. \
  I'm always happy to connect with new people â€“ just reach out.",
